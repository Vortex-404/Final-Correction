# Revert Log: Navigation and Error Fixes (June 2025)

## What Was Done

### 1. Navigation Bar Restoration
- Restored the navigation bar (with Home, Apply for Exeat, History, Track Progress, Profile) on the following pages:
  - admin.html
  - parent_approval.html
  - hod_approval.html
  - dean_approval.html
  - notification.html
- This makes the navigation consistent for all user-facing and admin/approval pages, as previously implemented.

### 2. Error Fixes
- Cleaned up unused imports and variables in:
  - register.js (removed unused 'set' import and 'errorCode' variable)
  - firebase.js (removed unused 'latestStatus' variable)
- All other main files (admin, approval, notification, profile, history, exeat, login) have no syntax or compile errors.

## Why
- The navigation bar was reverted back to the full version for a consistent user experience across all pages, as requested.
- Code warnings and errors were fixed to ensure a clean, maintainable codebase.

## How to Revert Again
- To remove the navigation bar from admin/approval/notification pages, simply delete the `<div class="nav-links">...</div>` section from those files' nav bars.
- To restore any removed code, refer to your version control or previous backups.
